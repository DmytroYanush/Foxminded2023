This code was created as part of a course to prepare for working with Unreal Engine 4.
The course was structured around completing a series of assigned tasks without any prior lectures or similar guidance â€” at most,
I was given a few links to some websites, which usually contained only very general information.
Everything written in this code, except for the randomizer, 
is my intellectual work based on textbooks and, only occasionally, on information from websites. 
At the time, I probably hadnâ€™t even heard of ChatGPT. ðŸ™‚
I also rarely asked the mentors what or how to do something.
I usually only sent the task for review once it was fully completed. 
Occasionally, though rarely, I had to make some revisions.
